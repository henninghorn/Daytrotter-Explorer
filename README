About Daytrotter Explorer
This web application is build by Henning Horn.
It fetches random Daytrotter Sessions and gives you the opportunity to discover new artists, in a slightly easier faster way, than on Daytrotter's website.

If you want to download a track, you simply right-click on the track and select "Save destination/link...".
You can also share the current playing track, by copying the link in the address bar of your browser.

Daytrotter Explorer has no affiliation with Daytrotter.

Made possible with jQuery and Audio Player.
